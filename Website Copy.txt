Home / About
	Coral's Surf Shack
		Coral's Surf Shack is based at the beach hut on Fanore in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland and provides a friendly, safe and fun introduction to the exhilarating art of surfing.
		
		Our expert crew of surf-dude instructors invite you and your friends to come and experience the thrill and excitement of surfing at Ireland’s best kept secret. Bryan started Coral's Surf Shack out of a desire to live on the west coast and to share the thrill of surfing. You are very welcome to Coral's Surf Shack where surfing classes and surf lessons come highly recommended.
		
	MAKING SURFING EASY
		We have Ireland’s biggest range of surf school surfboards. From 10 foot monster boards, that make surfing easy for taller/stronger perople, to 6 foot short boards, we have you covered. No matter what your surfing ability or experience, our aim is to make surfing easy for you. That’s when it gets fun!
	
	SURFING TOGETHER
		We organise our lessons in different ways. We have Family, Adult, Child, and School groups. One of the keys to becoming a better surfer is having fun with other people who share your interest. The easier it is, the more fun you have. Our head instructors have been with us since we started!
		
	Equipment Rental
		Surf Rentals are available at Coral's Surf Shack. We have a full range of BIC hard boards and 1 and 3 fin soft boards.
		Rental sessions are based on two hours and rentals are made from our beach hut at the end of Fanore. All rentals have to remain in Fanore Beach. To rent you need to be a good swimmer, an advanced or intermediate surfer and be over 18 years of age (for insurance reasons).
		Conditions vary so much in Fanore, so on choppy days we only rent to advanced level surfers. No matter what level you are at you can always learn so much in a two hour surf lesson, it’s safer and usually easier for yourself. Thus we do whenever possible recommend a surf lesson.
		Boards:
			– Full Range of BIC hardboards
			– Softboards of all sizes
			– Full range of 5/3 mil winter wetsuits, boots & hoods
		Prices:
			– Surf Board with Winter Suit & Boots for two hours costs €20
